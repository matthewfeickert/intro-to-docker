You can cleanup/remove a container [`docker rm`][docker-docs-rm]
~~~
docker rm <CONTAINER ID>
~~~
{: .source}

You can remove an image from your computer entirely with [`docker rmi`][docker-docs-rmi]
~~~
docker rmi <IMAGE ID>
~~~
{: .source}

> ## Remove an image

> Pull down the Python 2.7 image from Docker Hub and then delete it.

> ## Helpful cleanup commands
> What is helpful is to have Docker detect and remove unwanted images and containers for you.
> This can be done with `prune`, which depending on the context will remove different things.
> - [`docker container prune`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_prune/) removes all stopped containers, which is helpful to clean up forgotten stopped containers.
> - [`docker image prune`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_prune/) removes all unused or dangling images (images that do not have a tag). This is helpful for cleaning up after builds.
> - [`docker system prune`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/) removes all stopped containers, dangling images, and dangling build caches. This is very helpful for cleaning up everything all at once.

> ## Worth cleaning up to save disk
> Docker images are just lots of compressed archives, and they can take up lots of disk pretty fast.
> You can monitor the total disk being used by Docker with [`df`][docker-docs-df]
