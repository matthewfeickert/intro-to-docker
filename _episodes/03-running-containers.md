To use a Docker image as a particular instance on a host machine you [run][docker-docs-run]
it as a container.
You can run in either a [detached or foreground][docker-docs-run-detached] (interactive) mode.

Run the image we pulled as an interactive container

~~~
docker run -it matthewfeickert/intro-to-docker:latest /bin/bash
~~~
{: .source}

You are now inside the container in an interactive bash session. Check the file directory

~~~
pwd
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
/home/docker/data
~~~
{: .output}

and check the host to see that you are not in your local host system

~~~
hostname
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
<generated hostname>
~~~
{: .output}

Further, check the `os-release` to see that you are actually inside a release of Debian
(given the [Docker Library's Python image][docker-hub-python] Dockerfile choices)

~~~
cat /etc/os-release
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)"
NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"
VERSION_ID="10"
VERSION="10 (buster)"
VERSION_CODENAME=buster
ID=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.debian.org/"

## Monitoring Containers

Open up a new terminal tab on the host machine and
[list the containers that are currently running][docker-docs-ps]

~~~
docker ps
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE         COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
<generated id>      <image:tag>   "/bin/bash"         n minutes ago       Up n minutes                            <generated name>
~~~
{: .output}

Notice that the name of your container is some randomly generated name.
To make the name more helpful, [rename][docker-docs-rename] the running container

~~~
docker rename <CONTAINER ID> my-example
~~~
{: .source}

and then verify it has been renamed

~~~
docker ps
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE         COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
<generated id>      <image:tag>   "/bin/bash"         n minutes ago       Up n minutes                            my-example
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Renaming by name

>You can also identify containers to rename by their current name

>docker rename <NAME> my-example

{: .callout}

# Exiting and restarting containers

As a test, create a file in your container by printing the current datetime into a file

~~~
date > test.txt
~~~
{: .source}

In the container exit at the command line

~~~
exit
~~~
{: .source}

You are returned to your shell.
If you list the containers you will notice that none are running

~~~
docker ps
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
~~~
{: .output}

but you can see all containers that have been run and not removed with

~~~
docker ps -a
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE         COMMAND             CREATED            STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
<generated id>      <image:tag>   "/bin/bash"         n minutes ago      Exited (0) t seconds ago                       my-example
~~~
{: .output}

To restart your exited Docker container [start][docker-docs-start] it again and then
[attach][docker-docs-attach] it to your shell

~~~
docker start <CONTAINER ID>
docker attach <CONTAINER ID>
~~~
{: .source}

> ## Starting and attaching by name
>
>You can also start and attach containers by their name
>
>~~~
>docker start <NAME>
>docker attach <NAME>
>~~~
>{: .source}
{: .callout}


Notice that your entry point is still `/home/docker/data` and then check that your
`test.txt` still exists with the datetime you printed into it

~~~
ls
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
test.txt
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
cat test.txt
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
Wed Aug 26 08:03:53 UTC 2020
~~~
{: .output}

So this shows us that we can exit Docker containers for arbitrary lengths of time and then
return to our working environment inside of them as desired.

>## Clean up a container

>If you want a container to be [cleaned up][docker-docs-run-clean-up] &mdash; that is
>deleted &mdash; after you exit it then run with the `--rm` option flag
